#+TITLE: Adding a right-click pop-up menu to Flutter widgets

Desktop Flutter has gotten a lot better, but I ran into a problem when developing a side project of mine, UKR. There didn't seem to be a native form of Pop-Up menu for pointer devices, such as a mouse on desktop (Or a stylus).

In this post I'll be showing a way to implement this feature using only Flutter's built-in functionality.

* Prerequisites

Flutter. That's about it. Although I'd suggest having a desktop build available where you can properly test this feature.

* Implementation
