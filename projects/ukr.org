* About

  UKR (Universal Kodi Remote) is a Kodi remote application. It's built with Flutter, which gives it excellent cross-platform capabilities.

  The reason I started developing this application is because I was tired of inconsistent and unintuitive UI across the Kodi remotes of different platforms that I use (Web, iPadOS, Android).

** Languages
   Currently being developed for english only. More language options may be added in the future.

* Installation
  
  Currently no installation builds are available. Linux and Android will be first to be added.

* Building from source

  1. Clone the git repository to your computer.
  2. Run /Pub Get Packages/ in the root directory of the repository.
  3. Run the build command of you choice.
